# WithBounceVerticallyAnim

The Higher Order Component will apply an animated effect of "bouncing" to the wrapped component, as it is in the button example.

Use WithBounceVerticallyAnim to wrap any component, to generate a dynamic fixed animation in the app

## Props Table

Right now, it only has one prop, and it is the wrapped component, as `children`.

In the future, will add different controls to be able to control the animation

<Story name="Button Bounce" args={{
    children: 
        <ButtonOptions 
            btnText="Click me" 
            variant="contained" 
            onClickBtn={() => {console.log("button clicked")}}
        />,
}}>
    {Template.bind({})}
</Story>

<ArgsTable story="Button Bounce" />
